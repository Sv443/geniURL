description: Get started with using geniURL to fetch lyrics metadata
---

## Introduction
geniURL is a simple JSON and XML REST API to search for song metadata, the lyrics URL and lyrics translations on genius.com.  
Authorization is not required and geniURL implements a fuzzy search that will greatly improve search results over the genius.com API.  
Obtaining actual lyrics sadly isn't possible.
